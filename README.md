### Description

With this code, you can paint/print a picture or some text to the screen. It is VERY simple to use, just a few API calls. I thought of it one night while I was thinking about what would be a cool example to make. I thought that if I can paint the pixels of a PictureBox, then why not try to paint the pixels of the desktop window! Please check this code out AND DON'T FORGET TO VOTE FOR IT!!!
